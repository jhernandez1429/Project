<p><h3>ELIZA is possibly the first chatbot ever created, dating back to 1966. It was created by Joseph Weizenbaum as an early experiment in natural language processing (NLP). ELIZA is able to hold a conversation in English with a human, and is programmed through a set of pattern matching rules to respond to the user in ways that are similar to how a psychotherapist would.</h3></p>
